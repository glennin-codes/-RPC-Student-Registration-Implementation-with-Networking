##Title: RPC Calculator - C Implementation with Networking

Description:
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) system in C, showcasing a simple calculator application. It utilizes the RPC framework to enable communication between a client and a server, allowing remote function invocation. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features:

    RPC implementation using C language
    Client-Server architecture for remote function invocation
    Calculator functionality with support for arithmetic operations
    Robust error handling and input validation

Technologies Used:

    C programming language
    RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
    Networking using sockets

Instructions:

    Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
    Build the server using the provided Makefile: make server
    Start the server: ./server
    Build the client using the Makefile: make client
    Run the client: ./client

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different inputs, and expand the functionality as per your requirements. Enjoy learning about RPC and networking with this project!
